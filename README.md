#### ***Starting and Ending Locations***

The user profile is further supported by the fact that most of starting and ending locations of Citibike rides occured between 
Midtown (Times Square) to Downtown Manhattan (One World Trade Center). The two areas represents majority of where the 9-5 office crowds were located as well as tourism hotspots. The 81% subsribers should mainly consists of office crowds while the remaining 19% should represents tourist who use the services as needed.

## **Summary**
The Citibike data visualizations have shown that majority of the customers consist of subscriber (81%) while the remaining were customers (19%). Based on the US Bureau of Labor Statistics#, the average employment in Des Moines were averaging 320,000 from May to Oct 2020. In other statistic, the Greater Des Moines area also attracted 13.7m visitors in 2016##.

The business model in Des Moines will need to be different than New York City due to the fact that the population density in New york City is much higher than Des Moines. The ideal customer distribution between subscriber and customer should be 50/50. Since the Des Moines attracted considerable amount of tourists each year, it should create a special packages that will attract visitors to Des Moines. In the same token, it will also need to attract office crowd who work in the Des Moines area working with local government to promote healthly lifestyles and provide incentive for bikers who rode bike in downtown Des Moines. 

The other two visualization that I would suggest for future analysis is to analyze Des Moines census data by looking into the population density, total work force, workforce with Bachelor degree or higher. These data would help further analyze if the Citibike business model in New York City can be applied in City of Des Moines, Iowa.
